# About

Some simple utility bash scripts to help in everyday work.

## up.sh

Allows users to go up n levels in directory structure instead of repeating command 'cd ..' multiple times. Instead, write `up n`, where n is a number of times you want to go up.

## upto.sh

Makes it possible to go up in the directory structure until certain directory name is found. For example, if you're in a folder '/home/user/some/deep/nesting/levels' and you want to get to the folder `some`, just write `upto some`.
